#+title: NixOS Configuration
#+author: Lucien Cartier-Tilet <lucien@phundrak.com>

This repository contains the NixOS configuration for my personal
setup. It uses Nix Flakes to manache the configuration, making it
reproducible and easy to share across my different machines.

* Repository Structure
- =flake.nix= :: The main entry point for the Nix Flake. It defines my
  NixOS configurations as well as a dev shell which installs the tools
  needed for testing and building my configurations.
- =hosts/= :: Directory containing host-specific configurations. Each
  host has its own directory with at least a =configuration.nix= file.
- =modules/= :: Custom NixOS modules that can be reused across different
  hosts.
- =programs/= :: Programs shared across hosts at the system level that
  are not made into configurable modules.
- =secrets/= :: Contains secret values that I cannot or will not share
  publicly.
- =system/= :: Common system-level configuration shared across hosts
  that are not made into configurable modules.
- =users/phundrak/= :: My home-manager configuration, containing
  user-specific settings and applications.
- =users/modules/= :: Custom user NixOS modules that can be reused
  across different users.
- =user/scripts/= :: Custom shell scripts shared across users.

* Updating and Rebuilding the Configuration
In this repository, there are two helper scripts:
- =update.sh= :: Updates the Flakeâ€™s lockfile.
- =rebuild.sh= :: Rebuilds the configuration and switch to it
  immediately.
